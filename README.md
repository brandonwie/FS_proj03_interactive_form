# Interactive Form with jQuery

This is my second personal jQuery project with Treehouse.

## Fullstack - 3rd Project with Treehouse

For consistancy, this project is mostly built by using jQuery.

1. Form Validation with RegEx

- Custom built regexes are used to get the most out of the experience. (Thanks to [regex101.com](regex101.com))

2. Realtime Validation
   -change(), keyup() are used to create a better user experience

3. To provide smooth user experience

- Depends on categories, users see only related items (t-shirt section)
- Doubled activities are automatically disabled when users choose activities to participate.
- Total cost is automatically calculated.
- Regarding what payment methods users choose, different steps appear on the screen.
