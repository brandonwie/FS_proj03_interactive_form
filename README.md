# Interactive Form with jQuery

This is my second personal jQuery project with Treehouse. Although I love vanila JavaScript, it is worthwhile to learn how to use jQuery as it took a huge part in web-development.

## Fullstack - 3rd Project with Treehouse

For consistancy, this project is mostly built by using jQuery.

1. Form Validation with RegEx

- Custom built RegEx-es are used to get the most out of the experience. (Thanks to [regex101.com](regex101.com))

2. Realtime Validation

- change(), keyup() are used to give a better user experience

3. To provide smooth user experience

- Depending on categories, user see only related items (t-shirt section)
- Doubled activities are automatically disabled when user choose activities to participate.
- Total cost is automatically calculated.
- Regarding what payment methods user chooses, different steps appear on the screen.
